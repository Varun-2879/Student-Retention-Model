# Student-Retention-Model
This is an ongoing student prediction model I am have been working on. This is a classification predicitive model that predicts if the 
new incoming student is likely to withdraw from univeristy/college. 
I have used SMOTE, implemented cross-validation and applied XGBoost for an accuracy of 91.16%
